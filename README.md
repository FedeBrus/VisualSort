# VisualSort
VisualSort is a sorting algorithm visualizing tool that was created for the purpose of making sorting algorithms easier to understand for new programmers.

## Dependencies
Visualsort depends on pygame to play the sound so you will need to install it with `pip install pygame`

## Installation
If you are using Windows you can simply download the release containing the executable of VisualSort. 

Otherwise you can always clone this repository using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fedebrus/visualsort
```
## Future updates
In the next releases we plan to add more sorting algorithms, several color themes and an information page for every algorithm.

## Authors 
VisualSort was created by FedeBrus, Nikicoraz and FratelloDog.
